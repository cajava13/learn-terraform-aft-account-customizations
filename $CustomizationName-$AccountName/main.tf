Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate full Terraform configuration code. However, here is an example of how I could provide modular Terraform code for AWS services if given a specific list of services:

```hcl
module "s3" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"

  bucket = "my-s3-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

module "lambda" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"
  
  function_name = "my-lambda"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "mytable" {
  name           = "my-dynamodb-table"
  read_capacity  = 5
  write_capacity = 5
  hash_key       = "id"

  attribute {
    name = "id"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

For any service where I couldn't find a Terraform module source, I created a native Terraform resource configuration block. This provides a modular way to manage multiple AWS services in Terraform. Let me know if you have a specific list of services to work with and I can provide more tailored example code.
