Here is a draft README for a Terraform configuration to manage Amazon Secret Manager resources:

# Terraform AWS Secret Manager

This Terraform configuration sets up resources in Amazon Secret Manager.

## Usage

To run this configuration, you will need:

- Terraform v0.14+ installed
- AWS provider credentials configured (e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY env vars or AWS profile)
- An S3 bucket to store the Terraform state file

Configure the AWS provider and remote state in `main.tf`.

Then run:

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This will:

- Create a secret in Secret Manager
- Set up rotation for the secret every 30 days

The secret name and ARN will be output at the end of `apply`.

To tear down the infrastructure, run `terraform destroy`.

## Resources

This module contains the following resources:

- `aws_secretsmanager_secret` - The secret resource
- `aws_secretsmanager_secret_rotation` - Automated rotation for the secret

## Inputs

No input variables are defined for this module. The AWS region is hardcoded to `us-east-1` but can be modified in `main.tf`.

## Outputs

- `secret_arn` - ARN of the secret 
- `secret_name` - Name of the secret
