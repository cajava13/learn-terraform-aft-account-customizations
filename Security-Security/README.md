Here is a draft README for a Terraform configuration to manage Amazon Secret Manager resources:

# Terraform AWS Secret Manager

This Terraform configuration sets up resources in Amazon Secret Manager.

## Usage

To run this configuration, you need to have Terraform installed and configured with AWS credentials.

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Resources

The following resources are created by this Terraform configuration:

- `aws_secretsmanager_secret`: Creates a new secret in Secrets Manager to store sensitive data such as passwords or API keys. The name and description can be configured.

- `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version`: Adds a new secret value to the secret created above. This stores the actual sensitive data. Subsequent applies can update or overwrite this value.

## Inputs

The following inputs can be configured for the Terraform configuration:

- `secret_name` - The name of the secret to create
- `secret_description` - An optional description for the secret
- `secret_value` - The sensitive data to store as the secret value

## Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

- `secret_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created secret
- `secret_version_id` - The unique identifier of the current secret version

## Usage Notes

- Secrets and secret versions are never retrieved directly through Terraform to avoid exposing sensitive data. Retrieve secrets through the AWS SDK or console instead.
