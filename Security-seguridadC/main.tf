Here is a Terraform configuration for an AWS KMS module:

```terraform
module "kms" {
  source = "org/kms/aws"

  key_description = "My KMS key"
  deletion_window_in_days = 7  
  enable_key_rotation = true

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

This sources the KMS module from the Terraform registry path "org/kms/aws". It passes in a key description, deletion window, enables key rotation, and specifies some tags.

The module would handle the implementation details of creating a KMS key in AWS. Any additional KMS resources not covered by the module could be defined directly in this Terraform configuration as AWS resources.

Let me know if you need any other services configured or have additional questions!
